# Expo TODOs

## Feature

- layouts
    + top
    + documentation
    + blog
- `bulmaswatch` support
    + deal with default CDN links
- i18n

## Layouts

The `_default` layout is designed for gitbook-like documentation. In Expo all sections would be treated as docs by default, but we special case content with type `post` so that contents under `post` section is rendered as blog entry.
