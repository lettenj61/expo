# Get started with EXPO

Here we show you how to start working with the theme.

## Installation

### Set up `hugo`

Since EXPO is a hugo theme, you have to set up [hugo][hugo] first.

If you haven't set up hugo yet, follow its official instruction [here][hugo-install].

### Make `EXPO` your theme

After you setup fresh site, let's grab `EXPO` theme. You can do this in either way:

1.  Download assets from [repository][repo].

2.  Add the theme to your site's `git` repository as `submodule`.

That's all! Now you're ready to write documents using EXPO.
